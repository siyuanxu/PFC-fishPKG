========================================================================

fistPkg | PFC | Date/Description
25  | 5.00.30 | 03/20/17
  Enhancements.
   1. Support clumped grains to provide general grain shapes --- see the
      common material parameters cm_shape and cm_ctName. Examples of
      clumped-grain models for granular materials are given in the Linear and
      User-Defined Materials Examples in the fistPkg memo. An example of
      clumped-grain models for bonded materials is given in the Contact-Bonded
      Material Example.
   2. Modify crack-tracking logic: (a) to reduce slowdown caused by crack
      filtering, and (b) by setting default value of ckUpdateRate to be two
      million --- the cracks are updated (by a call to ckForceUpdate) at the
      end of each loading stage before creating the SAV file.

24 | 5.00.27 | 10/14/16
  Enhancements.
    1. Update PFC 5.0 from 5.00.24 to 5.00.27.
    2. Fix crack-tracking bug that caused the diameters of some flat-jointed
       cracks to be assigned to the wrong flat-jointed elements.
    3. Complete the flat-joint interfaces plot set to display the interface,
       coordinate systems and discretization.
    4. Add the faced grain plot set. Known bug: 3D faced grains are not being
       drawn correctly.
    5. New technical memo {Flat-Joint Contact Model [version 1]} in
       Documentation\FlatJointContactModel that provides a comprehensive and
       fully up to date description of the FJ formulation. There are some
       minor differences from the PFC 5 docSet. This memo also contains a
       two-grain test problem (in
       ExampleProjects\FlatJointContactModel\Test-TwoGrains) and exercises the
       faced-grain plot set.

23| 5.00.24 | 06/23/16
  Enhancements.
    A. Enhance crack monitoring: (1) define the crack gap as the surface gap
       (associated with the contact model), instead of the gap between the two
       contacting balls; and (2) enhance crack filtering to display the
       gap-based filtering criterion in the plot caption.
    B. Rename master project directories to remove the "my" designator, for
       example:
         myMatGen-X ==> MatGen-X, where
           X = {Linear, ContactBonded, ParallelBonded, FlatJointed, Hill}
         myCompTest     ==> CompTest
         myDiamCompTest ==> DiamCompTest
         myTenTest      ==> TenTest

22| 5.00.24 | 05/16/16
  Enhancements.
    A. Replace use of term "deviatoric stress and strain" in Section 5.1
       {Stress, Strain and Porosity in the Material} of the fistPkg memo with
       the term "deviator stress and strain." Modify all references to this
       term in the memo and in the project files, in particular, modify the
       title and y-axis label in all pl-wsd_wea views.
    B. Clarify description of the Hertzian component of the hill contact model
       in Section 1.4 {Hill Material} of Potyondy (2016). Describe the
       grain-grain system as "two locally elastic spheres." Refer to the
       Hertzian component of the surface-interaction force model as
       Hertz-Mindlin springs [replaces use of Hertzian springs], with the
       Mindlin portion of the term denoting the tangential response. Provide a
       footnote summarizing the contact formulation of the Hertz-Mindlin
       springs, with associated references from which the general solution is
       obtained for sphere-sphere and sphere-plane contacts between two
       elastic bodies with different radii and elastic constants. Describe the
       Hertzian component of the surface-interaction force model as providing
       "...the nonlinear force-displacement response arising from mutual
       compression of two elastic bodies, which induces a local deformation of
       the bodies in the vicinity of the contact surface. The local
       deformation is determined by the shapes and elastic constants of the
       bodies in the vicinity of the contact surface."

         Potyondy, D. (2016) "Hill Contact Model [version 4]," Itasca
         Consulting Group, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, Technical Memorandum
         ICG7795-L (May 13, 2016).
    C. Update PFC 5.0 from 5.00.23 to 5.00.24.
    D. Remove the MakeThenTest drivers for the myMatGen projects, and replace
       with following scheme. Provide run projects [MatGen&Test-RUN] for each
       material to create that material and perform appropriate laboratory
       tests upon it. Provide master run project [MatGen&Test_AllMats-RUN] to
       create and perform appropriate tests on all materials. Modify all
       projects to exit upon completion.
    E. Provide plot-generation data files for material genesis, and each
       laboratory test: X-MakePlots.{p2,p3}dat, where X = {MatGen, CompTest,
       DiamCompTest, TenTest}.

21 | 5.00.23 | 04/18/16
  Enhancements.
    A. Modify @mvListProps to list current and initial vessel dimensions. Fix
       the figures of the linear and hill example materials to show vessel
       dimensions at the end of material genesis, which are less than the
       initial vessel dimensions because the boundary-contraction packing
       procedure moves the vessel walls inward. The previous figures showed
       the initial vessel dimensions.
    B. Clarify specification of measurement regions within the material vessel
       --- see new material-vessel parameters mv_inset{D,L}Fac, and note the
       renaming of _mvMpFac{W,H} ==> mv_inset{D,L}Fac.
    C. Microstructural plotting is now off by default, it had been on by
       default. Microstructural plotting is turned on by @msOn. It can also be
       turned on at the end of material genesis by specifying [true] as the
       value of the new second parameter of mpMake in the material-genesis
       driver file. For large models, with more than 15000 grains, the
       microstructural plots require significant memory with a corresponding
       increase in save-file size. For large models, it is better to keep
       microstructural plotting off, and only activate it by calling @msOn
       when generating a microstructural plot.
    D. Reset grain displacements to zero after the seating phase of the
       tension and compression tests.
    E. Add MakeThenTest drivers to myMatGen projects.

20 | 5.00.23 | 02/26/16
  Enhancements.
    A. Enhance support for computation of grain size distribution via
       @gsdGetSizeOfPercentile(pct), which returns grain size corresponding to
       percentile {pct} for grain size distribution in GSD table created by
       @gsdMeasure.
    B. Improve microstructural monitoring (see Section 3.0 in fistPkg memo).
    C. Add description of resilent modulus computation as a means to quantify
       the deformability of a granular material (see Section 5.2 in fistPkg
       memo).
    D. Add the hill contact model to the fistPkg as a user-defined contact
       model. The hill contact model is described in Potyondy (2016a). The
       creation and triaxial testing of a hill material are described in
       Potyondy (2016b, User-Defined Material Example). A material-behavior
       study that compares the responses of the linear and hill materials for
       narrow and broad grain-size distributions is given in Section 2.3 of
       Potyondy (2016a). The following modifications were made to the
       user-defined material interface, and to the hill contact model:
         o Provide new file udm_hl.p3fis for udm redefinitions, and replace
           udm_setMatBehavior with hlm_setMatBehavior.
         o Rename hill model property suc_coef => suction.
           Rename hill model parameters:
             hlm_sucCoef    => hlm_suction
             hl_makeDry     => hlm_makeDry
             hl_makeWet(gm) => hlm_makeWet(psi, gm)

19 | 5.00.22 | 01/12/16
  Create microstructural plot sets --- see Section 3.2 {Microstructural Plot
  Sets}. Hide many of the views, they are manipulated via the Documents
  button. Modify default values of _mvMpFacH and _mvMpFacW from 0.9 to 0.8;
  these values control the size of the measurement spheres used to measure
  stress and strain in the material.

18 | 5.00.22 | 12/10/15
  Enhancements.
    A. Modify compression test for bonded materials to provide two additional
       hidden views (pl-mer_wea, pl-mev_wea) to be used during UCS tests. The
       wall-based radial and volumetric strains are not measured during UCS
       tests, and thus, the corresponding measurement-based quantities must be
       used to plot radial and volumetric strain versus axial strain curves.
    B. Enhance microstructural monitoring to include: microstructural
       properties (overlap ratios [mp_ORs] and bond coordination number
       [mp_CNb]); crack filtering and gaps; and microstructural plots --- see
       Section 3.0 {MICROSTRUCTURAL MONITORING}.

 17 5.00.21  09/22/15
             Enhancements.
             (a) Enhance compression test to include uniaxial-strain test (by
                 setting ct_testType = 2).
             (b) Delete grains with centers lying outside of the material
                 vessel at the end of step 2 of the packing phase.
             (c) Compute grain size distribution (GSD) of synthetic material
                 by calling sdMeasure(numBins) to create table GSD, which is
                 displayed in view pl-GSD (see Section 2.9 {Microstructural
                 Properties} of the material modeling support memo).

 16 5.00.20  07/22/15
             Minor enhancements.
               * Force chains can now be displayed as either bi-colored to
                 denote tension and compression or scale-colored to denote
                 magnitude (see plot items: "Contact force chain" and "Contact
                 force_mag"). This capability is described as follows. The
                 macroscopically applied compressive load is carried by the
                 granular material as force chains that propagate from one
                 grain to the next across grain-grain contacts. The
                 force-chain fabric is depicted as a network of cylinders,
                 with a cylinder at each contact. Force magnitude corresponds
                 with cylinder color and thickness, and force direction
                 corresponds with cylinder orientation.
               * Add {Section 5.4 Loading Rate} to memo {Material Modeling
                 Support in PFC}.
               * Improve setup phase of UCS test to move platens away from
                 specimen at ten times the previous rate.
               * Add geometry set "viewBox" to material-genesis to allow one
                 to display a box of a specified size on each plot (via the
                 Geometry plot item).

 15 5.00.17  04/22/15
             Add capability to create a user-defined material, with a
             user-defined material example that creates a 3D hill material.

 14 5.00.15  02/17/15
             Add diametral-compression test for PFC2D, with usage example for
             the 2D parallel-bonded material.

 13 5.00.15  02/05/15
             Remove the packing parameters: pk_emod and pk_krat. These two
             properties are replaced by the properties of either the linear
             material group (lnm_emod and lnm_krat) or the user-defined
             contact model (as specified in the udm_setMatBehavior FISH
             function).

 12 5.00.15  02/02/15
             Two enhancements: (1) Add a spherical material vessel. (2) Add
             diametral-compression test for PFC3D, with usage example for the
             parallel-bonded material. Break the material-modeling support
             memo into three related memos named "Material-Modeling Support in
             PFC," and "Material-Modeling Support in PFC (Example Materials
             {1,2}."

 11 5.00.15  01/27/15
             Two modifications: (1) Fix bug in computation of servomechanism
             gain in axial direction for 3D cylindrical vessel, and improve
             computation of wall-based stresses (now controlled by
             mv_wAreaMode). (2) Add Potyondy (2014) to documentation directory
             (see reference in entry for fistPkg 10).

 10 5.00.15  01/20/15
             Modify "Material-Modeling Support in PFC" memo to correspond with
             updated PFC 5.00.15 documentation set, and to refer to Potyondy
             (2015). Enhance compression test to support fully unconfined
             tests. [REFERENCE: Potyondy, D.O. (2015) "The Bonded-Particle
             Model as a Tool for Rock Mechanics Research and Application:
             Current Trends and Future Directions," Geosystem Engineering,
             18(1), 1-28.]

 09 5.00.14  11/17/14
             PFC 5.0 FISHTank released to users as fistPkg09.

 08 5.00.14  10/20/14
             Update the PowerPoint slide set that summarizes Potyondy (2014a).
             REFERENCE: {Potyondy, D. (2014a) "Material-Modeling Support in
             PFC," Itasca Consulting Group, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, Technical
             Memorandum ICG7766-L, October 20, 2014.}

 07 5.00.14  10/10/14
             Initial release of the PFC 5.0 Fishtank, which provides the
             following capabilities (for both PFC2D and PFC3D): material
             genesis of linear, contact-bonded, parallel-bonded and
             flat-jointed materials (all grains are balls) in physical
             material vessels (cylindrical and polyaxial) with compression and
             direct-tension testing.

 06 5.00.14  09/19/14
             Minor enhancements since fistPkg05. fistPkg06 has been released
             for selective internal Itasca review.

 05 5.00.14  09/04/14
             Material genesis of linear, contact-bonded, parallel-bonded and
             flat-jointed materials in physical material vessel with
             compression and direct-tension testing (PFC3D only, all grains
             are balls). Not yet available: (1) extend to support PFC2D, (2)
             allow grains to be clumps, (3) provide Brazilian-tension and
             fracture-toughness tests, (4) provide smooth-jointed interface
             and (5) provide stress-installation procedure.

04a 5.00.9   07/25/14
             THIS IS A PRIVATE VERSION of ongoing developments, created for
             use of Derrick Blanksma. It supports creation of a linear
             material, and compression testing of that material. Note that it
             has been tested with PFC 5.00.9, it should probably work with
             more recent versions of PFC as well.

 03 5.00.9   06/25/14
             Modified interface to compression-test procedure to make it
             correspond with description in the memo: "Material-Modeling
             Support in PFC."

 02 5.00.9   06/22/14
             Material genesis and compression testing can be performed on the
             linear material for which all grains are balls.

 01 5.00.7   06/10/14
             Establish initial tank to support creation of linear material and
             compression testing (PFC3D only).
